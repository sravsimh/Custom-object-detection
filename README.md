# Custom-object-detection

this repository is based on the yolov5 and can be used to make a custom object detection model with your custom data.

To use this repo just create a labelled dataset in yolo format and replace that with the exsisting dataset.

then change the datase.yaml file and add your path and classes in correct order, then just follow along with the jupyter notebook for training and using the model.

feel free to raise any issues or a pull request.
